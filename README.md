# Welcome to the Zunalita Labs Repository

> *Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories. The failed experiments are as much as part of the process as the experiments that work. "If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules". Book by Chérie Carter-Scott, July 15, 1998.*

This repository hosts experimental files created for the **Zunalita** web platform — for functions in a testing and exploration phase.

### About Contributions
This repositoryu is aimed to already collaborators-only, so **external contributions are not open at this time**. However, you are welcome to explore the code, learn from it, and follow along with our progress.

### Purpose
This is a space for testing ideas, prototypes, and new features that will help shape Zunalita over the time. Everything here is experimental — and that’s what makes the process so exciting.

Thank you for your interest and curiosity!
